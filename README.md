# panda-configurator

This repo contains a rendition made in Vue.js and Typescript of a Fiat Panda configurator concept, made by [Riccardo Bonu](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6674236018876563457/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A(ugcPost%3A6671463905430163456%2C6674235956909916160)).

Optimized for *Helvetica Neue* font (it will definitely look better if you have *Helvetica Neue* installed on your OS).

I used the CSS Backdrop Filter, so there could be some compatibility issues with Firefox. Check the [CanIUse CSS Backdrop Filter page](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-backdrop-filter) for further information on Backdrop filter browser compatibility.

The project is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://edo-san.github.io/panda_configurator/#/)
